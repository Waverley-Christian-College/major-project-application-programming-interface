## **The Ultimate Volatility Tracker by Marcus, Bosco & Andrew**

What does this Feature do?

This tracker is designed to help compare the Volatility between different companies you desire, as well as our very own Volatility Scoring System, which can show how high or low the volatility is

Features:

**Show multiple graphs**

Programmed by Marcus

This feature asks the user how many companies they want to see; in regard to that, the feature will ask the user what companies they want to see. Then the computer will generate a graph for the user to look at that shows the prices of all those companies over a certain period of time.

**Volatility Scoring System**

Programmed by Bosco, Algorithm by Andrew

This feature asks for what company and between which the user wants to see. Through a really complicated algorithm, the feature will calculate aver average difference in prices over the months and the average share price over the months. This will then tell the user how much, on average, the prices had deviated over the months, and by using our scoring table, you can tell how high or low the volatility was over that period.
